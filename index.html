                        <p>Overall the kind of art that most enjoy is traditional art. Sketching is the one that I practice the most since I find it easier to give depth to objects with simple black, grey, and white shades. Shown above is a W.I.P. of a rose that I have in my sketchbook. I've sketched most of my drawings with the same mechanical pencil for the last seven years, it's one of my best buddies.</p>

                        <p>Although sketching with graphite is what I usually practice, I have tried as of recently to start using color, specifically colored pencils. Carrying around a set of colored pencils can be more challenging that just carrying around 1 pencil, and because of this I usually don't do many colored drawings. Colored drawings tend to take longer to finish as well, which doesn't make them a good candidate when things are busy. As is clear in the image above, my flowers are my muse.</p>

                        <p>Recently I have begun to collect playing card decks. My brother was the one that got me into collecting playing cards after he got me a fancy deck of cards for my birthday once. What I look for in cards is that the design is intricate and it's definitely a bonus if the cards have a special finish like foil. Above are some of my favorites from my collection and it is clear that these are very detailed.</p>

                        <p>Nail polish is another thing I like to collect
                            (*cough*...hoard...*cough*) even though I don't really use it that often. I have been told by many its an "unwise investment", but I don't see it as an investment; I see it as another artistic outlet. Above there are some of my collection boxes for my favorite nail polish brand. The brighter and shinier the better. I try my best to find the most fun colors and effects for this collection.</p>

                        <p>A hobby I have had to sadly put aside for the moment is reading. This "hobby" falls under the habit section because of my tendency to start a book and put it down roughly after 3 chapters, and then find another book I'm interested in and moving on to that one. This leads to handfuls of unfinished books on my shelf. But fun fact: a person needs to have at least 1,000 books to be considered to have a library, and I'm a 1/10 of the way there so I don't plan to stop reading.</p>

                        <p>And finally but certainly not least, is music. Even though I don't play any instruments I do listen to music a lot and it is something that I have considered essential since a very young age. My music taste has changed throughout the years, but I consider myself to have the same if not the same interest I have had in it since the beginning. Currently I listen to punk, rock, and pop music.</p>
